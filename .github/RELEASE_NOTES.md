RockshinOps is a local desktop system monitor with persistent menu bar metrics, English/Chinese UI, process and app inspection, disk space analysis, selected cleanup and macOS app removal.

### New in v0.2.8

- Search apps and indexed files from a global-shortcut launcher, with pinyin matching, reveal and copy-path actions. Configure it in the new Launcher sidebar page.
- View available macOS chip temperatures, SMC power and fan readings, thermal pressure and active power assertions on the Energy page. Availability depends on hardware.
- Fix shortcut recording focus in the macOS WebView.

**中文：**新增支持拼音搜索应用和文件的快捷键启动器；能耗页显示可用的 macOS 温度、功率、风扇、热压力及电源断言；修复快捷键录制焦点问题。

### Upgrade notice / 升级说明

Old LocalOps installations require a manual installation of RockshinOps because their updater relaunches the old executable path. Linux system packages should be updated through the package manager.

旧 LocalOps 用户需手动安装 RockshinOps；Linux 系统软件包请通过包管理器更新。

macOS builds remain ad-hoc signed and not notarized; Accessibility or Screen Recording permissions may need to be re-granted after replacement.

### Downloads

- **macOS Apple Silicon:** the `arm64.dmg` file.
- **macOS Intel:** the `amd64.dmg` file.
- **Windows x86_64:** the `Setup … amd64.exe` installer.
- **Linux x86_64:** the `.deb` package or `.tar.gz` archive (extract and run `./rockshinops`; no install script is included).
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` contains checksums for all packages. `update-*.json` and the macOS/Windows `.tar.gz` files are consumed by the updater; choose the installers above for manual installation.

### Platform status

System collectors are implemented for macOS, Windows and Linux. All four native CI runners sample CPU, memory, disk, network, processes and a known TCP socket. Interactive desktop acceptance has been performed on macOS Apple Silicon; interactive Windows/Linux desktop verification remains device-dependent.

This release has not completed interactive Windows/Linux acceptance, multi-display/fullscreen and sleep/wake coverage, or every macOS tray/third-party menu interaction.

GPU support: macOS IOKit, Linux AMD sysfs or NVIDIA SMI, Windows NVIDIA SMI. Drivers must expose the relevant counters. Missing GPU, battery or power telemetry is shown as unavailable. Linux displays the first system battery; Windows uses system battery status.

macOS packages are ad-hoc signed and not notarized. Windows packages are unsigned. Operating systems may require explicit approval to open downloaded apps. Update archives are signed independently of OS code signing.

Language defaults to the system preference. Choose **System default / 中文 / English** in Settings; changes are saved automatically. Review is required before moving selected items to the system trash. Emptying the trash requires explicit confirmation; process termination requires a separate confirmation naming the process and PID.

See the repository README for installation, dependencies and measurement details.
